# Introduction

An old friend of mine had a ritual. At the end of the day, she picked three things that brought her joy that day. It was a reminder to of be thankful, and a way to go to sleep with a smile on her face.

It's a habit I've tried, and I've struggled to do it on my own. Since I'm a developer, my first thought is to automate it. To me, it's an ideal project. It's a way to use my gifts to help other people recognize the joy in their lives.

## Motivation

In 2011, I saw [a TED talk by Salman Khan](http://www.ted.com/talks/salman_khan_let_s_use_video_to_reinvent_education) that inspired me to go to grad school and take charge of my own life. I put Khan Academy at the top of my dream jobs, but wanted to prove myself (mostly to myself) that I can succeed. I've spent 3 and a half years working for Groupon learning about scale, architecture, code quality, testing, and a diverse set of skills needed for the industry.


Now, I'm on my way to Khan Academy, and threejoys.today is my launch pad. I chose to use Google App Engine for the backend so I can learn more about the KA tech stack, while using an Ember front end to let me show off in the way I know best.

## Blog

This blog will document the journey of creating an application. Often, non-technical friends and family are curious why building applications are hard. I'll document some of the aspects that are unexpectedly tricky, as well as anything that I'd exceptionally proud of or excited about.

Whether you're here to learn about building apps or simply to enjoy the final product, welcome. I hope this reminds you of your joys today.
